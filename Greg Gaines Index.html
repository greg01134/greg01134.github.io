    <h1>Greg Gaines</h1>

    <h2>Major: Computer Applications | Interest: My professional interest is in business management. I currently manage a large scale fitness facility and operate my own online coaching business.</h2>

    <p>
        My primary goal for this course is to master the fundamentals of web development, specifically learning how to structure content semantically. I want to understand how the "skeleton" of the web works before moving on to design and interactivity. I believe this is a great skill to have when running a business and being able to operate in a dynamic business environment
    </p>

    <p>
        In my career, I aspire to work in Operational and or Technical Project Management. I believe that having a strong foundation in technical project management will help me lead teams effectively and bridge the gap between business requirements and technical execution. I believe the skills gained from this course will be very valuable in the future.
