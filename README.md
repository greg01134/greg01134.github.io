# Project 02: My Professional Project Repository

Welcome to my project repository! The purpose of this website is to demonstrate my ability to publish a live, version-controlled project on the web. By creating this repository, I have established a permanent home for my digital portfolio and mastered the fundamental workflow of modern collaborative development—moving from local files to a public, professional product.
