# Project 02: My Professional Project Repository

The purpose of this website is to showcase my understanding of how to properly publish my work using professional version control. By deploying this site, I am demonstrating the necessary steps to initiate, manage, and complete a web development project. This repository serves as proof of my competence in handling the full "idea-to-live-product" workflow.
